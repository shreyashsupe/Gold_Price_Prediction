# Gold_Price_Prediction

A Machine Learning Project on, how to analyze and predict, the upcoming prices of Gold, using Random Forest Regressor.

Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. 
It operates by constructing several decision trees during training time and outputting the mean of the classes as the prediction of all the trees


For a better understanding of what are we had done in this project, let us refer to a workflow to know our plan.

We had trained a machine learning model, then use the trained model for prediction. Similarly, any model can be made much more precise, by feeding a very large dataset, to get a very accurate score.
